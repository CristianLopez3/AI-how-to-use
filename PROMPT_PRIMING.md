# What Makes a Good Prompt? ‚úÖ

Great outputs all come down to the data the model was trained on, its **parameters**, and good **prompting**. Since we can only control one of these, here's what good prompting boils down to:

- **Clear and concice** language that is direct and unambigouos.
- The **persona** that you assign to ChatGPT, aka who it will be acting as in your prompt.
- The **information** and **examples** that you provide, aka your **input**. (Information and examples can be referenced by ChatGPT in the previous chat history).
- A specific **task** that you are requesting ChatGPT to complete, aka your desired **output**
- **Refinement** as need once you receive your first response, aka reiteration until receiving the desired output.

## What is Prompt Priming? üßê

Prompt engineering is the process of **designing** and **optimizing** prompts used in natural language processing
(NLP) models, such as ChatGPT, chatbots, or virtual assistants. This involves crafting prompts that are clear,
concise, and effective in eliciting the desired response. (Aka prompt engineering is like making an effective fishing
lure - just as a well-designed lure is more likely to catch the fish you want, a **well-crafted** prompt is more likely to
elicit the desired response.)

### 3 principles of prompt engineering  üìù

1. **Be specific:** The more criteria you give, the more focused the output will be.
2. **Work in steps:** Break tasks into small chunks. This returns better results, just as it would with a human.
3. **Iterate and improve:** Re-work the inputs and have ChatGPT improve on its own output.


## Main Prompting Steps ü¶∂ 

1. **Define the problem or goal**: Clearly articulate what you want ChatGPT to help you with and what kind of response you are looking for.

2. **Use relevant keywords and phrases**: Input the most useful industry and topic-related terms into the prompt, which will help guide ChatGPT toward generating the desired response.

3. **Write the prompt**: Craft a concise prompt that clearly communicates the information and task that is required, using the keywords and phrases identified in steps 1 and 2.

4. **Test, evaluate, and iterate**: Generate responses with ChatGPT, evaluate the results, and adjust the prompts as necessary to elicit the desired response. Repeat the process until a successful prompt is created that consistently generates the desired response.


## What Makes a Good Prompt

Great outputs all come down to the **data** the model was trained on, its **parameters**, and good **prompting**. Since
we can only control one of these, here‚Äôs what good prompting boils down to:

‚Ä¢ **Clear and concise** language that is direct and unambiguous.

‚Ä¢ The **persona** that you assign to ChatGPT, aka who it will be acting as in your prompt.

‚Ä¢ The **information** and **examples** that you provide, aka your **input**. (information and examples can be referenced
by ChatGPT in the previous chat history)

‚Ä¢ A specific **task** that you are requesting ChatGPT to complete, aka your desired **output**. 

‚Ä¢ **Refinement** as needed once you receive your first response, aka reiteration until receiving the desired output.

## Prompt Priming

**Priming** refers to the practice of providing some initial input to the model before generating a response.
The initial input is intended to guide the model toward generating a response that is more relevant and coherent with the user's intended output. (You can put entire pieces of text you've written for ChatGPT to be trained on).

### Example 1 ü§Ø

**Without priming:** Where should I go on my next vacation?

**With priming:** I'd like to go on a trip with my wife and kids, the location should be tropical, we'd love to be close to the beach, I'd like the flight to be one direct flight to and from LAX, and i have a travel budget of $5,000. Where should I go on my next vacation?

**Priming Output:** One suggestion for your tropical family vacation within a $5,000 budget could be Cancun, Mexico. Direct flights from LAX are available, and you can find affordable all-inclusive packages with prices starting at around $1,000 per person for a week-long stay. Popular family **family activities** in Cancun include snorkeling, visiting ancient ruins, and exploring local beaches and restaurants.

### Example 2 ü§Ø

**Without priming:** Please create 3 potential titles for my new online course that teaches how to use AI.

**With priming:** Please create 3 potential titles for my new online course that teaches how to use AI. Here is an
example of my recent course titles, _please emulate the styling and written format of these: ‚ÄúVideo Editing
Masterclass: Edit Your Videos Like a Pro!‚Äù ‚ÄúCinematography Masterclass: The Complete Videography Guide‚Äù_

**Priming Output:**

1. AI Mastery: The Complete Guide to Using Artificial Intelligence
2. The AI Expert: Learn to Harness the Power of Artificial Intelligence
3. AI Foundations: A Step-by-Step Guide to Using Artificial Intelligence

## General Prompt Frameworks üì≥

Presented below are a set of general prompt frameworks **designed** to be applicable to all scenarios while still
generating **detailed** and **effective** outputs. By providing the following frameworks, these prompts enable ChatGPT
to produce more helpful and **accurate** responses on a consistent basis.

## **RGC Prompting**:

This framework presents a robust structure that can be applied **universally to any input and intended output**. Its
objective is to establish a standardized format that optimizes the framing for ChatGPT and thereby enhances its
performance across a broad spectrum of inputs.

**Prompt Formula**

‚Ä¢ **Role** - ChatGPT‚Äôs persona (You are an expert marketer)
‚Ä¢ **Result** - Desired output (Create 5 emails ending with a call to action)
‚Ä¢ **Goal** - Purpose of the output (The goal is to drive sales to my product)
‚Ä¢ **Context** - Who, what, where, why (The emails are for my online audience of entrepreneurs)
‚Ä¢ **Constraint** - Limitations and guidelines (The emails should be friendly and less than 200 words)

**Examples** 

‚Ä¢ You are an expert **[role]**. Create **[result]**. The goal is **[end goal]**. The content is for **[context]**. Your guidelines for writing
are **[constraints]**.

‚Ä¢ You are an **expert marketer**. Create **5 emails ending with a call to action**. The goal is to **drive sales to my product**. The
emails are **for my online audience of entrepreneurs**. The emails should be friendly and less than 200 words.

‚Ä¢ You are an expert nutritionist. Create a 7 day meal plan for my 5 foot 7, 40 year old, female client who exercises 3
times a week. The goal is for her to lose 1 pound of fat a week by being in a caloric deficit and eating the right amount
of carbs, sugar, and protein. She doesn‚Äôt eat pork and wants to spend $200 per week on food. The meal plan
should give the recipes, cooking directions, preparation times, and a specific meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

## I Want You To Act As Prompting: üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This second option presents another robust structure that can be applied **universally to any input** and intended
output. Its objective is to establish a standardized format that optimizes the framing for ChatGPT and thereby
enhances its performance across a broad spectrum of inputs.

**Prompt Formula**
1. **‚ÄúI want you to act as a...‚Äù** (historian, biologist, etc.) This helps to set the stage for ChatGPT‚Äôs persona.
2. **‚ÄúI will give you...‚Äù** (my target audience, a specific direction, a product, etc.) This is where you set up the dynamic
between you and ChatGPT.
3. **‚ÄúYou will then...‚Äù** (create 5 emails, make a video script, summarize, etc.)
4. **‚ÄúIn a _____ tone/style...‚Äù** (upbeat, professional, tabular format) This is where you explain your desired output along
with the personality/style of writing for the output.
5. **‚ÄúThe important details are...‚Äù** (target audience, cost per project, etc.) Be sure to explain all important details and
elaborate on specifics from bullet point 2.
6.Refine your output as needed **‚ÄúBe more persuasive‚Äù** ‚ÄúPut the most important keywords in bold‚Äù ‚ÄúNow put this in
tabular format‚Äù

**Examples**

‚Ä¢ I want you to act **as a personal coach**. I will give you **my personal and professional goals**. You will then create a 7
day schedule in tabular format for me to follow in order to hit my goals. My short term daily goals are meditate,
workout, read, and work on my projects. My long term goals are to sign 30 new clients and save $10,000 over the next
6 months.

‚Ä¢ I want you to act as a virtual doctor. I will describe my symptoms and you will provide a diagnosis and treatment
plan. You should only reply with your explanation, diagnosis, and treatment plan, and nothing else. My important
details are, "I have been experiencing a headache and dizziness for the last few days, what could be the cause?‚Äù
