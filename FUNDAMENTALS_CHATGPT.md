## ChatGPT 🆚 Google

ChatGPT and Google search are both AI-powered tools, but they differ in several ways:

1. **Purpose 🔪**: Google search is a search engine that helps you find information on the web, while ChatGPT is an interactive tool that not only finds you the information you're searching for but can **"intelligently"**, process that information and personalize for your needs/prompts.

2. **Input ⌨️**: Google search requires a user to type in a query, whereas ChatGPT interacts with users in a conversational or iterative manner, you must work with it to get the desired output such as asking follow up questions. (Even if yoou don't know what question to ask.

3. **Output 📤**: Google search provides a list of links to web pages that contain the information you're looking for, while ChatGPT generates responses in natural language that are tailored to your specific needs.

4. **Scope 🎯**: Google search is limited to the information available on the web, while ChatGPT can generate responses based on a wide range of data sources, including books, articles, and other text-based content.
